# I-Built-my-First-static-website-using-Amazon-S3-and-infinityfree.

I recently built and deployed my very first static website using **Amazon S3** and a free domain from **InfinityFree* all without spending a penny.

## Step-by-Step Overview

1. **Created a simple HTML file**
   - Includes a "Elamur Beauty Salon" message and a slogan: *The Beauty lies in your Hair*

2. **Saved it as `index.html`**
   - This file acts as the homepage of the website

3. **Uploaded it to an Amazon S3 bucket**
   - Enabled static website hosting
   - Set permissions to make the file publicly accessible

4. **Connected a free domain from InfinityFree**
   - Set up redirection to the S3 website URL

5. **Tested the live site**
   - Verified that the site loads correctly and is accessible to others

6. **Wrote a full tutorial on Dev.to**
   - Includes screenshots, code snippets, and setup instructions
